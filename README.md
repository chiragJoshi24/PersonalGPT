# PersonalChatGPT

## Description

This project implements a command-line chatbot for question answering. It leverages FAISS for context retrieval and OpenAI's language model for generating responses. Users can input questions via the command line, and the chatbot provides answers based on pre-defined context stored in a text file.

## Features

-   **Question Input:** Users can input questions interactively via the command line.
-   **Context Retrieval:** Utilizes FAISS for efficient retrieval of relevant context from a stored text file.
-   **Response Generation:** Integrates OpenAI's language model to generate accurate and contextually relevant answers.
-   **User-Friendly Output:** Answers are presented to the user in a clear and understandable format.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies: Langchain, FAISS, and OpenAI API.
3. Run the script and follow the command-line prompts to input questions.
4. Receive answers generated by the chatbot based on the provided context.
